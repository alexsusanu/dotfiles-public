# Zoxide Integration for ~/.bashrc

# What this does:
# eval "$(zoxide init bash)" sets up zoxide integration in your bash shell
#
# Breaking it down:
# - `zoxide init bash` generates shell code to integrate zoxide with bash
# - `$()` command substitution, runs the command and captures output
# - `eval` executes the captured output as shell commands
#
# What it actually does:
# - Creates the `z` command for smart directory jumping
# - Sets up command history tracking so zoxide learns your patterns
# - Adds shell hooks to monitor directory changes
#
# Usage examples after adding this:
# - `z documents` jumps to ~/Documents (or any directory matching "documents")
# - `z proj` jumps to ~/workspace/my-project (if you've visited it before)
# - `zi` opens interactive directory picker
# - `z` with no args shows your most used directories
#
# Without this line: zoxide is installed but not integrated (no `z` command)
# With this line: `z` command works and learns your directory patterns

# Menu-style completion - cycle through matches with Tab
bind "set menu-complete-display-prefix on"
bind '"\t": menu-complete'

# Usage:
# - Type 'cd doc<Tab>' and it will complete to 'Documents/'
# - If multiple matches, press Tab repeatedly to cycle through them
# - Case doesn't matter: 'CD doc<Tab>' also works
